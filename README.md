Taking the Intimidation Out of WordPress Plugin Development
===========================================================

Our talk will be from a beginners perspective on plugin development. We will talk about how we approached designing and developing our first plugin for Wordpress- a minimum quantity plugin for Jigoshop. Dan will talk about the development focusing on what resources he used and how he tackled learning Wordpress functions, hooks & plugin limitations with little Wordpress knowledge. Jen will speak about the design aspect focusing on the specific plugin behavior, user interaction and how it would integrate into the storefront.
